# Colorful Squares

## Part 1

Write a python program using `pycat` (not jupyter notebook!) to create an output like the one in the picture below.

Hints:

- Use a `for` loop to draw lots of sprites
- Each sprite has a random position
- Each sprite has a random scale
- Each sprite has a random color using `self.color = Color.random_rgb()`

## Part 2

Extend your previous program so that the sprites slowly fall down to the bottom of the screen, as shown in this video.
